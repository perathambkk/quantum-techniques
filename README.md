# quantum-techniques
A collection of quantum information/algorithm codes in python's [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) from IBM.\
Some are from [the Qiskit's textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook) [GitHub](https://github.com/Qiskit/textbook/tree/main/notebooks).

## Requirements
Install requirements.txt file to make sure correct versions of libraries are being used.

* Python 
* Jupyterlab
* qiskit

also, ```pip install git+https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-textbook.git#subdirectory=qiskit-textbook-src```
as depicted in [the Qiskit's textbook setting the environment](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-prerequisites/setting-the-environment.html). 

The codes/notebooks should be compatible with most qiskit versions since recent qiskits do not use Aer and the syntax has changed a lot for the simulator part. The circuit part is pretty much the same ever.
